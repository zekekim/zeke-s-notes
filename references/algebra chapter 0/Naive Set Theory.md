# Naive Set Theory

**Sets** are a collection of objects

## Notation of Finite Sets
$$A:= \{1,2,3\}$$

this means that $A$ is defined as a set $\{1,2,3 \}$

> FYI: $:=$ is analogous to $=$

A set is not defined by it's order or the number of elements in the set, rather the elements that are listed, meaning:

$$\{1,2,3\}=\{1,3,2\}=\{1,2,1,3,3,2,3,1,1,2,1,3\}$$

## Notation of Infinite Sets

$$E=\{...,-2,0,2,4,6, ...\}$$
