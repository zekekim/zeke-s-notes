# Management

**Mission Statements** through **Objectives** and **Goals**.

## Accountability through Transparency

A coach should not have to yell at them to shoot the ball; they need to make the decisions on their own with guidance as well. Good managers **allow failure**.

**Enabling** means to give workers the education and tools they need to make decisions.
